"""
Simple transformer to shift an image that may have been mirrored. The JSON configuration requires three arguments:
amount of horizontal shift allowed (in pixels), amount of vertical shift allowed (in pixels) and a boolean to control
whether or not the image should be mirrored.

"config": { "width_pixels": 0, "height_pixels": 0, "mirror": 0 }
